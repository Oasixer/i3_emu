* One of the most useful things I want this program to allow me to do is use alt+hjkl to navigate places where arrow keys are normally used.
    * for example, most importantly, dropdown menus, to navigate the suggestions.
* App
    {
        config: {
         keybinds: {
         
         }
        }
        windows: [],
        fullExePath: "",
        name: ""
    }
